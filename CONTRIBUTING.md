# Guidelines for Contributing to Collection

## Building your local development environment

It is highly recommended to set up a python virtual environment for development.
Use the [Ansible Release and Maintenance](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html) to determine the oldest supported python version matching the current minimum ansible version from meta/runtime.yml.  
1. Install the ansible-core version matching the minimum ansible version from meta/runtime.yml.  
2. Install other python package requirements from requirements.txt.  
3. Create a fork of this repository, and clone it to your ansible collection path.  

```
$ mkdir -p ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/jeisenbath
$ git clone *your_repo* ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/jeisenbath/tripplite
$ cd ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/jeisenbath/tripplite
```

### Testing your code

1. Change directory to the collection's root.  
2. Run ansible-test sanity and correct any errors.  
3. Prepare integration tests by editing the test/integration/integration_config.yml **DO NOT COMMIT THESE CHANGES**  
    - If your change includes any files from module_utils, run a full integration test with ansible-test integration.  
    - If you are motifying a single module, or creating a new one, run ansible-test integration *target* to test only that specific resource.  

## Pull requests

### Pre-requisites for new pull requests

All pull requests should be submitted to the devel branch corresponding to the current major version.  
Pull requests should not include changes to the changelog itself, this will be done by maintainer when merging upstream.  
Pull requests should not include changes to galaxy.yml version, nor a build of the collection. This will be done by the maintainer when merging upstream.  
All changes MUST pass an ansible-sanity test.  

#### Major changes

Major changes include new modules and plugins.  
Major change PRs must:
- Include a changelog fragment with a major_changes section.
- Include an integration test for new modules.
New modules should:
- Import and use Tripplite from module_utils to manage API connection.
- Import and use tripplite_argument_spec from module_utils, and use corresponding document fragment.
- Include an integration test which tests for:
  - Check mode.
  - Present and absent for state based modules.
  - All expected return values for info based modules.
  - Idempotence.

#### Minor changes

Minor changes include new (non-required) parameters for modules, new roles or example playbooks, or documentation updates.  
Minor change PRs must:
- Include a changelog fragment with a minor_changes section.
- Pass existing integration tests.
Minor change PRs should:
- Include updates to integration test if including new parameters.
- Have either a corresponding open issue or discussion. This is to help ensure some degree of discussion available to all.
- Only update one module, role, or playbook per PR.
  - Exceptions may exist, such as when documentation is updated to reflect a shared resource.

#### Bugfixes

Bugfix PRs should:
- Have a corresponding open issue. This is to help confirm the bug is reproducable and not simply an issue with environment.
Bugfix PRs must:
- Include a changelog fragment with a bugfixes section.
- Not include any new features.

## Reporting Issues

General bug reporting guidelines
- Check existing Issues for similar sounding bugs.
- Review ansible-doc documentation and example playbooks when submitting questions. Incomplete, unclear, or inaccurate documentation is an issue!
- Explain your expected behavior versus the actual behavior.
- Include what version of ansible and of the collection you are using. If not using the current version, update and retest.
- Submit a test scenario with the simplest parameters possible to recreate.
